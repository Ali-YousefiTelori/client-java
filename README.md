signalGo client version for java

SignalGo is a library for Cross-Platform developers that makes it incredibly simple to add real-time web functionality to your applications. What is "real-time web" functionality? It's the ability to have your server-side code push content to the connected clients as it happens, in real-time. like WCF and SignalR!on the other hand you have bi-direction socket connection that both client and server can call each other!one more intresting thing is you can user signalGo .Net server verion for your backend and java version for client, and conversely!
